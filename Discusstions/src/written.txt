Question 1
a)(initialization) Does it start right? If the precondition holds and then the initialization routine is
run, does the loop invariant become true?
b)(Termination)Does it end right?Make a loop guard to make sure that the postcondition is true 
c)(Progress)will it end? In side the loop make progress toward were the loop guard is false and postcondition
is true
d)(Preservation)is the invariant always true? Make the loop body so that the invariant is always true.
Question 2
a) int k=0 boolen b= true
b)int k= c.length boolen b= true 
Question 3
a) loop guard: k<c.lenght
b) loop guard: k>0
Question 4
a)for(int k=0; k<c.length, k++){
if(c[k]!=0)
set c[k] to 0
}
b)for(int k= c.length k>0 k--){
if(c[k]!=0)
set c[k] to 0
}
Question 5
for(int h=b.length-1; h>0 h--;){
if(b[i] ==v){
break;
}
else if( h==0){
h=-1;
}
}
Question 6
   0    r     r+w  h      b.length
b: [ red|white|blue|   ?  ] 
h is the number of elements in ?
r is the number of elements in the red 
w is the number of elements in the white
   0        h           h+r   		h+r+w    b.length
b: [    ?   |	red		|	white	|	blue ] 
h is the number of elements in ?
r is the number of elements in the red 
w is the number of elements in the white
0          r         h+r   	h+r+w    b.length
b: [  red  |	?	|	white	|	blue ] 
h is the number of elements in ?
r is the number of elements in the red 
w is the number of elements in the white
  0        r           w+r   h+r+w    b.length
b: [   red |	white	|	?	|	blue ] 
h is the number of elements in ?
r is the number of elements in the red 
w is the number of elements in the white
