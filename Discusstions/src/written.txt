Question 1
a)(initialization) Does it start right? If the precondition holds and then the initialization routine is
run, does the loop invariant become true?
b)(Termination)Does it end right?Make a loop gaurd to make sure that the postcondition is true 
c)(Progress)will it end? In side the loop make progress toward were the loop gaurd is false and postcondition
is true
d)(Preservation)is the inveriant always true? Make the loop body so that the inveriant is always true.
Question 2
a) int k=0 boolen b= true
b)int k= c.length b= true 
Question 3
a) loop guard: k<c.lenght
b) loop guard: k>0
Question 4
a)for(int k=0; k<c.length, k++){
if(a[k]!=0)
set a[k] to 0
}
b)for(int k= c.length k>0 k--){
if(a[k]!=0)
set a[k] to 0
}
